I am gearing up for the EMBO Workshop, a deep dive into plasmid evolution and its connection to antimicrobial resistance (AMR).</p>

<p>Decoding Antibiotic Resistance Spread</p>

<p>Antimicrobial resistance is a global challenge, with bacteria becoming resistant to antibiotics. Plasmids, tiny genetic carriers, play a role by shuttling resistance genes between bacteria.</p>

<p>Unveiling Plasmid Secrets</p>

<p>At the EMBO Workshop, we’ll be exploring plasmid biology and ecology. Recent tech advancements allow us to better understand how plasmids contribute to AMR outbreaks.</p>

<p>Collaboration for Progress</p>

<p>The workshop is a hub of experts – from modelers to genetics researchers. I am thrilled to be part of this collaborative effort to address AMR challenges.</p>

<p>My Role in the Workshop</p>

<p>I’m eager to learn, contribute, and develop fresh approaches to tackle AMR. Stay tuned as we share insights from this enlightening experience.</p>

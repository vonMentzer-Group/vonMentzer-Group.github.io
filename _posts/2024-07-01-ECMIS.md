I'm are excited to share that I recently gave a keynote lecture at the E. coli and Mucosal Immune Systems (ECMIS) Conference in Ghent. The topic of the lecture was "Colonisation Factors in E. coli," an area of research that is both fascinating and vital to understanding bacterial pathogenesis.
<br>
We delved into the history of the nomenclature of adhesins, shedding light on the complexities and evolution of the terminology over the years. We also discussed the first visualisation of adhesins using transmission electron microscopy, marking a significant milestone in microbiology.
<br>
Additionally, I presented a summary of the latest research from our lab, which investigates colonisation factors across E. coli using large-scale genetic analyses. This cutting-edge research is helping to uncover new insights into how these factors contribute to bacterial colonisation and infection.
<br>
It was really exciting to give my first keynote lecture and I was happy to see some old friends at the conference too!
<br>
<br>
Stay tuned for more updates and detailed findings from our ongoing research!
